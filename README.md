# License Agreement <a name="licenseagreement"/>
Note that using this template is subject to the conditions of this [License Agreement](AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf).
Please review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. In short, you are allowed to use the template for free with Mule ESB Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio.

# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>
As a Salesforce admin I want to synchronize Contacts from Salesforce to a database.

This Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of Contacts from Salesforce instance to database. Everytime you hit the HTTP connector, integration will check for changes in Salesforce source instance in manner of one time integration and it will be responsible for updating the Contact on the target database table.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).

The batch job is divided into *Process* and *On Complete* stages.
The integration is triggered by a HTTP connector defined in the flow that is going to trigger the application, querying Salesforce updates/creations matching a filtering criteria and executing the batch job.
During the *Process* stage, each Salesforce Contact will be filtered depending if it has an existing matching Contact in the database.
The last step of the *Process* stage will group the Contacts and insert/update them in a database.

Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Template will log statistics into the console.

# Considerations <a name="considerations"/>

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source (Salesforce) and destination (Database) systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly.
**Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

This particular Anypoint Template illustrates the migration use case between Salesforce and a Database, thus it requires a Database instance to work.
The Anypoint Template comes packaged with a SQL script to create the Database table that it uses.
It is the user's responsibility to use that script to create the table in an available schema and change the configuration accordingly.
The SQL script file can be found in [src/main/resources/contact.sql](../master/src/main/resources/contact.sql)

This template is customized for MySQL. To use it with different SQL implementation, some changes are necessary:

* update SQL script dialect to desired one
* replace MySQL driver library dependency to desired one in [POM](pom.xml)
* update Database Config to suitable connection instead of db:my-sql-connection in global elements in [config.xml](../master/src/main/mule/config.xml)
* update database properties in `mule.*.properties` file

## DB Considerations <a name="dbconsiderations"/>

There may be a few things that you need to know regarding DB, in order for this template to work.

This Anypoint Template may be using date time/timestamp fields from the DB in order to do comparisons and take further actions.
While the template handles the time zone by sending all such fields in a neutral time zone, it can not handle **time offsets**.
We define as **time offsets** the time difference that may surface between date time/timestamp fields from different systems due to a differences in the system's internal clock.
The user of this template should take this in consideration and take the actions needed to avoid the time offset.


### DB as destination of data

There are no particular considerations for this Anypoint Template regarding DB as data destination.

## Salesforce Considerations <a name="salesforceconsiderations"/>

There may be a few things that you need to know regarding Salesforce, in order for this template to work.

In order to have this template working as expected, you should be aware of your own Salesforce field configuration.

### FAQ

 - Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one?

    [Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field][1]

- Can I modify the Field Access Settings? How?

### As source of data

If the user configured in the template for the source system does not have at least *read only* permissions for the fields that are fetched, then a *InvalidFieldFault* API fault will show up.

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: [InvalidFieldFault [ApiQueryFault [ApiFault  exceptionCode='INVALID_FIELD'
exceptionMessage='
Account.Phone, Account.Rating, Account.RecordTypeId, Account.ShippingCity
^
ERROR at Row:1:Column:486
No such column 'RecordTypeId' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting to use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom field name. Please reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'
]
row='1'
column='486'

# Run it! <a name="runit"/>
Simple steps to get Salesforce to Database Contact Migration running.


## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>
In this section we detail the way you should run your Anypoint Template on your computer.


### Where to Download Mule Studio and Mule ESB
First thing to know if you are a newcomer to Mule is where to get the tools.

+ You can download Mule Studio from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio)
+ You can download Mule ESB from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb)


### Importing an Anypoint Template into Studio
Mule Studio offers several ways to import a project into the workspace, for instance:

+ Anypoint Studio Project from File System
+ Packaged mule application (.jar)

You can find a detailed description on how to do so in this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Importing+and+Exporting+in+Studio).


### Running on Studio <a name="runonstudio"/>
Once you have imported you Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Once that is done, right click on you Anypoint Template project folder
+ Hover you mouse over `"Run as"`
+ Click on  `"Mule Application"`


### Running on Mule ESB stand alone <a name="runonmuleesbstandalone"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties](../master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`.
After this, to trigger the use case you just need to hit the local HTTP connector with the port you configured in your file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should hit: `http://localhost:9090/migratecontacts` and this will output a summary report and send it in the e-mail.

## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>
While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**.
Follow other steps defined [here](#runonpremise) and once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. Once your app is all set up and started, supposing you choose contactsmigration as domain name to trigger the use case, you just need to hit http://contactsmigration.cloudhub.io/migratecontacts and report will be sent to the e-mail configured.

### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub <a name="deployingyouranypointtemplateoncloudhub"/>
Mule Studio provides you with really easy way to deploy your Template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so please check this [link](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Deploying+Mule+Applications#DeployingMuleApplications-DeploytoCloudHub)


## Properties to be configured (With examples) <a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>

+ mail.from `batch.contacts.migration%40mulesoft.com`
+ mail.to `your.email@gmail.com`
+ mail.subject `Batch Job Finished Report`

# API Calls <a name="apicalls"/>
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider.
In this template only one Salesforce query is made so this is not something to worry about.


# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this Anypoint Template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organized by describing all the XML that conform the Anypoint Template.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you'll find in this application:

* [config.xml](#configxml)
* [endpoints.xml](#endpointsxml)
* [businessLogic.xml](#businesslogicxml)
* [errorHandling.xml](#errorhandlingxml)


## config.xml<a name="configxml"/>
Configuration for Connectors and [Configuration Properties](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are set in this file. **Even you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml<a name="businesslogicxml"/>
Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of excecuting the logic.
For the purpose of this particular Template the *mainFlow* just executes a [Batch Job](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing), which handles all the logic of it.



## endpoints.xml<a name="endpointsxml"/>
This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Template has only an [HTTP Listener Connector](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Listener+Connector) as the way to trigger the use case.
### Inbound Flow
**HTTP Listener Connector** - Start Report Generation

+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migratecontacts` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is a *request-response* since as a result of calling it the response will be the total of Contacts synced and filtered by the criteria specified.



## errorHandling.xml<a name="errorhandlingxml"/>
This is the right place to handle how your integration will react depending on the different exceptions.
This file holds a [Error Handling](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Error+Handling) that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.
