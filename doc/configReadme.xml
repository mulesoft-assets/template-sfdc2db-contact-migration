As a Salesforce admin I want to syncronize Contacts between Salesforce and database.

This Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of Contacts from one SalesForce instance to database. Everytime you hit the http endpoint, integration will check for changes in SalesForce source instance in manner of one time integration and it will be responsible for updating the Contact on the target database table.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages.
The integration is triggered by a http endpoint defined in the flow that is going to trigger the application, querying SalesForce updates/creations matching a filter criteria and executing the batch job.
During the Process stage, each Salesforce Contact will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching Contact in the database
The last step of the Process stage will group the Contacts and insert/update them in database.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Template will logoutput statistics data into the console.

<![CDATA[
To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source (Salesforce) and destination (Database) systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. 
**Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

This particular Anypoint Template illustrate the broadcast use case between Salesforce and a Database, thus it requires a Database instance to work.
The Anypoint Template comes packaged with a SQL script to create the Database table that uses. It is the user responsability to use that script to create the table in an available schema and change the configuration accordingly. The SQL script file can be found in [src/main/resources/contact.sql] (../master/src/main/resources/contact.sql)

Once you have imported your Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Add dependency for your Database driver to the pom.xml or simplt add external jar to the build path and rebuild project
+ Configure GenericDatabaseConnector in Global Elements section of the config flow to use your database specific driver. Classpath to the driver needs to be supplied here.
+ By default this template relies on existing table **"Contact"** in the database of your choice, so it will perform sql statements against this table, but feel free to customize prepared statements to use different database table or columns.
+ Once that is done, right click on you Anypoint Template project folder 
+ Hover you mouse over `"Run as"`
+ Click on  `"Mule Application"`

<![CDATA[
While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**. 
Follow other steps defined [here](#runonpremise) and once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. Every time a Contact is created or modified, it will be automatically synchronised to supplied database table.

		<section id="api_calls">
		<![CDATA[
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. Contact Broadcast Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

*** 1 + X + X / 200*** 

Being ***X*** the number of Contacts to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***200*** is because, by default, Contacts are gathered in groups of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).

Functional aspect of the Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow that will check for Salesforce creations/updates. The severeal message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Template:

1. During the Input stage the Template will go to the Salesforce and query all the existing Contacts that match the filter criteria.
2. During the Process stage, each Salesforce Contact will checked by name against Database, if it has an existing matching objects in database.
3. The choice routing element will then decide whether to perform update on selected database columns or peform insert
Finally during the On Complete stage the Template will logoutput statistics data into the console.
